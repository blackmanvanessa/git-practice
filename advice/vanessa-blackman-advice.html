                <h4>Just get started!</h4>
                <p>Don't over think this too much! There are so many internet resources that will get you started on your coding journey for free. Choose one and run with it. Is it kind of fun? Are you curious? Excited? Keep going.

                <h4>Baby steps.</h4>
                <p>Taking the first step can be difficult and looking at the long road ahead can be discouraging. You'll get there. One step at a time. Set micro-actions and goals to keep you on track. These little successes will give you motivation to keep going.</p>

                <h4>Consistency</h4>
                <p>Commit to doing something each day to get you closer to the finish line. Maybe it's spending an hour or two working through your leassons, maybe it's taking 5 minutes to read through a blog post defining the difference between web developer and web designer. The important thing is that you create a habit.

                <h4>Community</h4>
                Seek out a community that you can turn to for motivation and advice. People who believe in you, will encourage when the going gets tough, and celebrate when you reach those mini-goals along the way.

                <h4>Become a Skillcrusher!</h4>
